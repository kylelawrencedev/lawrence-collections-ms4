<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I have been wanting to create a clothing store for ages. I was tempted to create one for my MS3 project, but was told that I would learn about creating a store for my MS4 project. So now I can finally have a crack at it. 

I enjoy browsing and user simple sites. Some sites can get complicated. This site is simple and clean. I has all the necessary features and it is accessible and userable for users of all age groups.

Goals:
* Have a clothing site that is user-friendly and is accesible for users with disabilities
* Users feel like they can trust the site, as there are plenty of sites out there that look unsafe as soon as the sites loads. 
* Want users to be able to implement their own DRY principles. Nothing worse than having to keep repeating yourself when shopping. 

### Built With

Frameworks used for site
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

5. ### _Surface Plane_

	**Colour Palette**

	![Colour Palette](media/color_palette.png)

	* For the colours we used [Inclusive Color Palettes for the Web](https://medium.com/cafe-pixo/inclusive-color-palettes-for-the-web-bbfe8cf2410e). This site gave us several colours and colour palettes to look at which are inclusive for all users. These colours are user friendly for visually impaired and do not ruin the experience for users that are not visually impaired

	**Font**

	* Google Fonts was used to import the fonts Antic Didone & Opens Sans into the base.css file. These fonts were used throughout the site.

## Database Structure
When making the structure of the databse, I had to think of how the data would interact with each other. I wanted it to be logical and easy to follow. Every product it linked to a category, every review is linked to a user account, and every order is linked to a user.

Every order has its own order number that gets created once the users purchase is successful. This order number is then linked to the users account. If a user is not registered the order number is linked to the email they provide at checkout.

During development I used SQLite, which is provided by Django. For production I used Heroku Postgres. For production mode I also used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host all my static and media files.

You can see the data structure [here](DATABASE.md)
